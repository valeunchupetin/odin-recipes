    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Need a fluffy pancake recipe? This one is just right, especially when there's plenty of butter and syrup. Make it extra special with berries and cream!</p>

        <p>The secret to the fluffiest pancakes? Air! The combination of homemade buttermilk (milk and vinegar) and two leaveners (baking powder and baking soda) create lots of air bubbles in the pancake batter, resulting in the lightest and fluffiest pancakes imaginable.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>¾ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>

            <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to make sour milk.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into soured milk. Pour flour mixture into milk mixture and whisk until lumps are gone.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat it with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>

        </ol>
